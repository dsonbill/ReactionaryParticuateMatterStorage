    //Finite Capacity Definition (Darkness!) - Variable Wave Function
    //Targetting Well (Stronger in numbers, faster than a snap) - VWF Predicted Location
    //Photonic-Numeric Link (Information Cascades!) VWF Synchronization
    //Reasoning Definition Solution (Always At War!) - Internal Reasoning Reshaping
    //Finite Resource Establishment (Infinite Contact System!) - VWF/Spacetime Contact/Warping Definition
    //Existence Disestablishment / Metering Zone (Well that can't possibly work!) - Alternative Existence Apparatus

    //Subjugated Linkages (My favorites are always well known) - External Psychological Awareness
    //Automatic Zone Definition (Does this dress make me look fat?) - Effective External Area, Energy Release, and Density
    //Finite Escape Well (Sometimes it just gets away from me) - Variably-Controllable Energy Release Sites
    //Exterior Finite Definition (I wonder what I look like to them?) - Physical Shape and Size
