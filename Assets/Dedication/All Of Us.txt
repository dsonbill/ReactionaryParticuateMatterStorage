This program is for All Of Us and a piece of All Of Us is in here, somewhere.

The program is dediated to Nancy Smithon, my wonderful grandmother, who has always believed in me, though maybe not my behaviour or means.

The program is, of course, dedicated to my mother, Cheri, who can't always agree with me, but she would if she could.

The program is itelf dedicated to Daniel Lopez and Marko Donaldson, my dads, who I don't speak to about it much.

The program is obviously dedicated to Michael DeBenon, my father, who was the first one to teach me about life and the importance of music.

The program is - as well, of course - dedicated to my sisters: Jacquie, Danielle, and Rachel. They probably have their doubts that just about any
sane person would come up with regarding it, but they still listen to and believe in me.

The program is quite dedicated to Colin Donaldson, who helped me through my weakest times and made sure I always had something to smoke and eat
while programming. He eventually figured some of my ideas must at least be somewhat possible. We'll see them together along the way!


A final dedication is made to several special women in my life: T, D, L, A, M. These are the women I spoke to along the way who taught me the
importance of thinking romantically and with other perspectives, instead of just mine. They are the reason I can think about and create
the platform that Reactor is becoming today. They taught me how to paint.


Special thanks to Mars Argo an Poppy, for doing what they loved and love, respectively.

Let's see it grow into something rather special!
